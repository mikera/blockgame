Quite possibly the first 3D virtual world run entirely on a public decentralised network? The game engine is implemented in Convex Lisp, a Clojure-like language for on-chain smart contracts.

## Features

This is an experimental game exploring the boundaries of blockchain, metaverse, NFTs and gaming.

Features and ideas under development:

- NFTs used for game objects and land ownership rights
- Ability to "reify" digital assets as in-game objects
- Real money marketplaces via the Torus decentralised currency exchange
