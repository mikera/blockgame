Quite possibly the first 3D virtual world run entirely on a public decentralised network. The game engine is implemented in Convex Lisp, a Clojure-like language for on-chain smart contracts.

## Design

The game features a huge persistent virtual 3D space where players can build bases, explore new areas, build an army of minions, take on fearsome monsters and trade with other players.

All in-game items are managed and secure on [Convex](https://convex.world). These can be both fungible items or unique NFTs. A system of ownership enables players to control how other players interact with their items, land and minions.

 

## Features

This is an experimental game exploring the boundaries of blockchain, metaverse, NFTs and gaming.

Features and ideas under development:

- NFTs used for game objects and land ownership rights
- In-game trading of items and NFTs
- Ability to "reify" digital assets as in-game objects
- Real money marketplaces via the Torus decentralised currency exchange
- Off-chain AI controllers for monsters and rogue nations
- Time-based growth and harvesting of resources.
